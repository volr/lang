Volr documentation
================================

Volr helps neuroscientists and researchers to build, execute and introspect
neural systems experiments.

See the :ref:`installation` and :ref:`gettingstarted` pages for an immediate
dive into Volr.
The :ref:`userguide` and the manual pages contains more elaborate documentation
for more advanced use.

Getting the most out of Volr
----------------------------
Volr follows the
`UNIX philosophy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy>`_ of doing one
thing well: neural network experiment modelling.
It exists as a part of an ecosystem and a number of tools are required to make
proper use of Volr. 
Volr is still highly experimental.
